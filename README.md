🎓 Student Assistant AI App
This is an AI-powered academic assistant built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq. It's designed to help students quickly understand complex topics, analyze documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), and find relevant learning resources (YouTube videos and ArXiv papers).

✨ Features
Quick Search & Explanation: Get simplified explanations, key takeaways, and external resources for any academic topic.

Document Analysis: Upload and analyze PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.

Summarize: Generates a concise summary of the document.

Explain: Provides a clear, simplified explanation of the document's content.

Q&A (RAG): Ask specific questions about the document using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Resource Recommendation: Automatically fetches and recommends relevant YouTube videos and scholarly ArXiv papers.

High Performance: Leverages the Groq API for extremely fast LLM inference.

🚀 Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally on your machine.

1. Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
